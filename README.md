# ⚡ The Modern AI Developer Stack

**A curated list of tools, frameworks, and methodologies for the AI-enabled engineering team.**

This repository tracks the rapidly evolving landscape of AI development tools. It moves beyond simple "chatbots" to focus on **Agentic Workflows**, **Spec-Driven Development**, and **Developer Enablement**.

## 🔍 How to Use This Repo

- If you are a team lead:
  - Use this repo to standardize how your team sets up AI-enabled services.
  - Start with `AGENTS.md` for agent behavior and `docs/standards/` for language-specific guidelines.
  - Pick a collection under `collections/` (for example `collections/typescript-web-service.md`) as the default stack for new projects.
- If you are an individual developer:
  - Use the sections below to choose tools for your IDE, stack, and workflows.
  - When creating a new service, follow the relevant standards in `docs/standards/`.
- If you are an AI coding agent:
  - Always read `AGENTS.md` first.
  - For new subprojects, follow the language standards in `docs/standards/` and the relevant collection under `collections/`.

## 📚 Standards & Collections

- Language and service standards:
  - `docs/standards/typescript.md` – TypeScript/Node service layout, tooling, tests, and error handling.
  - `docs/standards/python.md` – Python service layout, tooling (pytest, ruff, mypy), and error handling.
- Ready-made stacks (collections):
  - `collections/typescript-web-service.md` – Opinionated stack for a TypeScript/Node web service with strict typing, Vitest, ESLint, and CI outline.

As you add more standards or collections, list them here so both humans and AI agents can discover them easily.

## 🏗️ Core Development (The "Hands")
*Tools that integrate directly into the coding workflow.*

* **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)** - The industry standard for in-editor code completion and chat.
* **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)** - An AI-native fork of VS Code. It indexes your entire codebase for superior context awareness.
* **[GitLab Duo](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/ai/)** - The integrated AI suite for the GitLab ecosystem (DevSecOps).
* **[Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)** - The "Agentic IDE" by Codeium. Uses "Flows" to maintain deep context across complex refactors.

### CLI & Terminal Agents
* **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/)** / **Open Code** - Command-line interfaces that allow LLMs to perform file operations and edits directly from the terminal.
* **[Aider](https://aider.chat/)** - The benchmark for AI pair programming in the terminal. Excellent at git-aware commits and refactoring.
* **[OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)** - A lightweight coding agent from OpenAI that runs locally in your terminal and integrates with ChatGPT and IDEs.
* **[Goose](https://github.com/block/goose)** - A local-first AI engineering agent that automates complex tasks using MCP servers, extensions, and recipes.

## 🧠 Architecture & Methodology (The "Brain")
*How we define software before the AI writes it. This is the shift to Spec-Driven Development (SDD).*

* **[Agents.md](https://github.com/simonw/agents.md)** - A proposal for a standard file format to document context/instructions for AI agents within a repository.
* **[GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)** - Tools and templates for defining structured specifications. This enables AI to generate high-quality code by strictly following a pre-defined "spec."
* **[OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec)** - Spec-driven development (SDD) for AI coding assistants, with change proposals, tasks, and spec deltas that tools can drive via slash commands or AGENTS.md. See `docs/workflows/spec-driven-openspec.md` for a full end-to-end example.

## 🤖 Building & Orchestrating Agents (The "Factory")
*Frameworks for building your own internal agents and tools.*

### Frameworks & Cloud
* **[Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)** - A standardized way to build multi-agent conversations and workflows.
* **[AWS Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/)** - Fully managed agents on AWS infrastructure.
* **[Microsoft Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai/)** - Comprehensive service for building and deploying AI apps on Azure.
* **[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)** - A library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. The standard for complex orchestration.

### Agent Libraries
* **[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction)** - A batteries-included framework for building LLM applications, with chains, tools, memory, and integrations across many providers.
* **[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)** - A data framework for connecting LLMs to your data, with indexing, retrieval, and RAG tooling.

### Connectivity & Skills
* **[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)** - The new open standard for connecting AI assistants to systems (databases, Slack, GitHub) without building custom integrations for every model.
* **[apm (Agent Package Manager)](https://github.com/danielmeppiel/apm)** - A package manager for distributing and installing AI agent "skills" and tools.
* **[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home)** - An open format for packaging reusable agent skills as folders of instructions, scripts, and resources.


### Low Code / No Code
* **[n8n](https://n8n.io/)** - Workflow automation tool that has pivotally embraced AI. Allows creating complex agentic workflows via a visual node interface.

---

## 🚀 Rapid Prototyping & GenUI
