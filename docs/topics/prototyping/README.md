# Prototyping (The "Sketchpad")

This topic covers tools that help you go from idea to working UI or app very quickly. These are ideal for experiments and MVPs, not necessarily long-term architectures.

---

## What Lives Here

- Full-stack app generators.
- Generative UI builders.
- Rapid experiment tools you can later harden into services that follow this repo's standards.

## Tools

- **Lovable** – Full-stack app generator from prompts.
  - Great for quickly exploring product ideas or internal tools.
- **GitHub Spark** – Platform for building and deploying intelligent apps.
  - Useful when you want prototypes that live close to your existing GitHub workflows and infrastructure.
- **v0.dev** – Generative UI tool from Vercel.
  - Produces React/Tailwind code you can export and refine.
- **Bolt.new** – Browser-based full-stack playground.
  - Fast way to sketch out interactions and validate ideas before committing to a repo.

When a prototype proves valuable, migrate the core ideas into a service that follows the standards in `docs/standards/` and uses the collections under `collections/` as a starting point.
